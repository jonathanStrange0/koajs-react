"koa-static" and "koa-mount" allow for serving the react app

you must change the cra provided manifest.json in /public to include
"start_url": "/",

and in the CRA provided package.json add the line:
"homepage": ".",

in the (koa) server file add the following:

const front_end = new Koa();
front_end.use(serve(`${__dirname}/../client/build`));
server.use(mount("/", front_end));

This serves up the CRA app at the mount point "/"
